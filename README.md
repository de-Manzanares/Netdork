This repository aims to be a collection of artificial neural net (ANN) tools and applications of said tools. 

### Structure

#### Tools

[ann_framework](ann_framework): The ANN library (if I can call it that). It's super teeny tiny for now.

#### Applications

[mnist](mnist): Training and testing of an MNIST Classifier

[xor](xor): A teeny tiny artifical neural network trained to behave as an XOR operator. Isn't that cute?
